# Flux Usernetes

We are going to test deploying usernetes with Flux and [Lima](https://lima-vm.io). Instead of having different VMs to start a separate control plane and workers, we are going to have several (identical) VMs that are running Flux, one with a lead broker, and have them connect (to make a Flux instance on a single cluster) and then launch usernetes in the job. Will it work? I have no idea. Let's gooo! For installation instructions of lima see [this top level README.md](../README.md). Note that you also need the special mount type! In the steps below we will:

 - [Manual Usernetes](#manual-usernetes): setup Usernetes and Flux separately and run usernetes inside a flux broker instance (done).
 - [Semi-automated Useretes](#semiautomated-usernetes): Started via a batch job in a Flux allocation.
 
Next we will do the same setup, but:

- Write the broker.toml in the VM build (it doesn't have anything changing in it)
- Do not setup usernetes manually, but instead in a batch job.

Note that for the VM builds it doesn't make it to the end, and I'm not sure why. I think I'm just bad with the probes? But the log reports exit code 0 and everything I expect is built, so likely me just being a noob.

## Semi-Automated Usernetes

This approach is semi-automated because we still need to start the flux broker for each node.

### Nodes

Create two instances. If you create more than 2, you'll need to edit the [flux-usernetes.yaml](flux-usernetes.yaml)
hosts list.

```bash
limactl start --network=lima:user-v2 --name=flux-0 ./flux-usernetes.yaml
limactl start --network=lima:user-v2 --name=flux-1 ./flux-usernetes.yaml
```

Note that I get this message 

```
FATA[0601] did not receive an event with the "running" status 
```

But can't narrow down the log to find some error that something didn't work! You should be able to list:

```bash
$ limactl list
NAME             STATUS     SSH                VMTYPE    ARCH      CPUS    MEMORY    DISK      DIR
default          Stopped    127.0.0.1:0        qemu      x86_64    4       4GiB      100GiB    ~/.lima/default
flux-0           Running    127.0.0.1:37091    qemu      x86_64    4       4GiB      100GiB    ~/.lima/flux-0
flux-1           Running    127.0.0.1:42509    qemu      x86_64    4       4GiB      100GiB    ~/.lima/flux-1
```

and shell into each:

```bash
limactl shell --workdir /home/vanessa.linux/usernetes flux-0
limactl shell --workdir /home/vanessa.linux/usernetes flux-1
```

#### Sanity Checks

If you choose, here are some sanity checks to ensure that everything started / is working as expected.

```
# 1. We have the curve certificate and broker.toml
$ ls /etc/flux/system/
broker.toml  curve.cert
```

And feel free to check the content.

```
# flux is installed (try flux start --test-size=4)
$ which flux
/usr/bin/flux
```

To check hostnames:

```
# The hostname is lima-flux-0 or lima-flux-1
$ hostname
lima-flux-0
```

And you should be able to reach other hosts via `<hostname>.internal`

### Bootstrap

Start the broker on each (in different terminals). 

```bash
command="flux broker --config-path /etc/flux/system/broker.toml -Stbon.fanout=256 -Slog-stderr-level=7"
limactl shell --workdir /home/vanessa.linux/usernetes flux-0 $command
limactl shell --workdir /home/vanessa.linux/usernetes flux-1 $command
```

The first terminal (after the second follower connects) should shell into an interactive
session.

```bash
Nov 22 04:18:57.864857 resource.debug[0]: reslog_cb: online event posted
Nov 22 04:18:57.865436 sched-fluxion-resource.debug[0]: resource status changed (rankset=[1] status=UP)
Nov 22 04:18:57.861593 broker.info[1]: quorum-full: quorum->run 0.206754s
vanessa@lima-flux-0:~/usernetes$ echo $FLUX_URI
local:///tmp/flux-vI20kb/local-0
```

You should see two nodes!

```bash
$ flux resource list
Nov 22 18:55:37.608721 sched-fluxion-resource.debug[0]: status_request_cb: status succeeded
Nov 22 18:55:37.608839 sched-fluxion-qmanager.debug[0]: status_request_cb: resource-status succeeded
     STATE NNODES   NCORES    NGPUS NODELIST
      free      2        8        0 lima-flux-[0-1]
 allocated      0        0        0 
      down      0        0        0 
```

Do a test job:

```bash
$ flux run -N 2 hostname
Nov 22 23:39:12.468908 sched-fluxion-qmanager.debug[0]: alloc success (queue=default id=1036479627264)
lima-flux-0
lima-flux-1
```

And this is where we can test submitting a job that sets up usernetes.

### Batch Job with Usernetes

The current idea I have is that a user can use a batch job to create their own personal usernetes cluster.
In fact, the job itself only cares about creating the cluster (and does not need to be changed). When the cluster
is created, a kubeconfig exists that the user can interact with even outside of the flux instance.
Since this design also makes it easier to test, this is what we are going to do.
You can write the contents of [batch-job.sh](batch-job.sh) into your interactive broker shell (in flux-0)
and submit:

```bash
flux batch -N 2 batch-job.sh
```

And you can watch `usernetes-job.out` to see that we list nodes.
Note that the join-command is a bit fussy, I find that sometimes it tells me containerd is not started.
We might need to work on the timing for that (it is currently my best guess).
If it works, you should see full nodes:

```console
...
make: Leaving directory '/home/vanessa.linux/usernetes'
Sleeping a bit...
No resources found in default namespace.
NAME              STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION
u7s-lima-flux-0   Ready    control-plane   2m10s   v1.28.0
u7s-lima-flux-1   Ready    <none>          106s    v1.28.0
```

When the job ends (hopefully) the trap command ends to bring down the containers.
If something happens and they don't go down on each node you likely need to do it manually. üò¨Ô∏è

```console
docker compose down -v
 Container usernetes-node-1  Stopping
 Container usernetes-node-1  Stopped
 Container usernetes-node-1  Removing
 Container usernetes-node-1  Removed
 Volume usernetes_node-etc  Removing

 Volume usernetes_node-var  Removing
 Network usernetes_default  Removing
 Volume usernetes_node-etc  Removed
 Volume usernetes_node-var  Removed
 Volume usernetes_node-opt  Removed
 Network usernetes_default  Removed
```

Once your cluster is running you should be able to export the KUBECONFIG in your home,
and (regardless of being in the flux instance) interact with your cluster.

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=/home/vanessa.linux/usernetes/kubeconfig
kubectl get nodes
```
```
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME              STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
u7s-lima-flux-0   Ready    control-plane   22m   v1.28.0
u7s-lima-flux-1   Ready    <none>          22m   v1.28.0
```

### Testing Other Abstractions

Once you have your cluster running, let's test it!

#### Batch Job

We can take the basic job example from the [Kubernetes site](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/).
I find this example especially good because it's for Pi, and tomorrow is Thanksgiving ;)

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://kubernetes.io/examples/controllers/job.yaml
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pods
```
If all goes well, the log should show... Pi! 

```bash
$ kubectl logs pi-x9xbw
3.141592653589...
```

#### Flux Operator

Let's run Flux inside of usernetes inside of Flux!

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flux-framework/flux-operator/main/examples/dist/flux-operator.yaml
```

<details>

<summary>Flux operator creation</summary>

```console
namespace/operator-system created
customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/miniclusters.flux-framework.org created
serviceaccount/operator-controller-manager created

configmap/operator-manager-config created
service/operator-controller-manager-metrics-service created
deployment.apps/operator-controller-manager created
```

</details>

You can look at the logs of the pod in the operator namespace to see the operator running! Next try running a LAMMPS job.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n operator-system 
```

Write this into `minicluster.yaml` on flux-0.

```yaml
apiVersion: flux-framework.org/v1alpha1
kind: MiniCluster
metadata:
  name: flux-sample
spec:
  size: 2
  tasks: 2
  containers:
    - image: ghcr.io/rse-ops/lammps:flux-sched-focal
      workingDir: /home/flux/examples/reaxff/HNS
      command: lmp -v x 2 -v y 2 -v z 2 -in in.reaxc.hns -nocite
```

Apply and watch it.

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./minicluster.yaml
kubectl get pods --watch
```

You can then see the whole log. Note that (on my local machine with VMs) it did seem to take a tiny bit longer to start than I'd expect on a local machine, but that is subjective.


```bash
kubectl logs flux-sample-0-qkm85 -f
```

I can't believe that worked! Amazing!
More examples will be added soon.


## Manual Usernetes

> This is no longer being used in favor of automated usernetes

Let's manually create two nodes to start (you can run these in separate terminals).
The index 0 (flux-0) will be the lead broker, and flux-1 a follower. These correspond
to hostnames lima-flux-0 and lima-flux-1, and each has their own IP address that we will 
need to derive for `/etc/hosts` in each VM.

```bash
limactl start --network=lima:user-v2 --name=flux-0 ./flux-usernetes.yaml
limactl start --network=lima:user-v2 --name=flux-1 ./flux-usernetes.yaml
```

The "user-v2" refers to the network, which you can find in `~/.lima/_config/networks.yaml`.
We can now shell in and start flux or finish the usernetes control plane.
This will eventually be done by flux, but not yet.
Note that typically usernetes would be in a home, but we aren't binding or creating one here.

```bash
# Change your home here to be your {username}.linux
limactl shell --workdir /home/vanessa.linux/usernetes flux-0
```

If you do this manually, flux-0 needs:

```bash
make up
make kubeadm-init
make install-flannel
make kubeconfig
export KUBECONFIG$HOME/kubeconfig
make join-command
echo "export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/kubeconfig" >> ~/.bashrc
```

And flux-1 needs:

```bash
# Change your home here to be your {username}.linux
limactl shell --workdir /home/vanessa.linux/usernetes flux-1
make -C ~/usernetes up kubeadm-join
```

### Manual Flux

Let's start trying to manually create a flux instance that connects the two VMs. The `/tmp/lima/broker.toml` references flux-lima-[0-1] so you'll need to get ip addresses for each vm with `ip a` and then add to the `/etc/hosts` of each VM:

```console
192.168.104.6  lima-flux-0
192.168.104.7  lima-flux-1
```

#### Lead Broker

Then shell into the flux-0

```bash
limactl shell --workdir /home/vanessa.linux/usernetes flux-0
```

And start the lead broker.

```bash
sudo chown $USER /etc/flux/system/curve.cert
brokerOptions="-Stbon.fanout=256 -Slog-stderr-level=7"
flux broker --config-path /tmp/lima/broker.toml $brokerOptions
```

```


Now on the flux-1 (first worker node) we do the same to connect.

#### Worker Broker

Then shell into the flux-1

```bash
limactl shell --workdir /home/vanessa.linux/usernetes flux-1
```

And start the follower broker:

```bash
sudo chown $USER /etc/flux/system/curve.cert
brokerOptions="-Stbon.fanout=256 -Slog-stderr-level=7"
flux broker --config-path /tmp/lima/broker.toml $brokerOptions
```

When it connects, the lead broker will appear to exit, but you are actually in the instance
and can get the URI.

```
$ echo $FLUX_URI
local:///tmp/flux-u3C8of/local-0
```

#### Usernetes

Finally, shell into the lead broker and connect to the running flux instance:

```bash
limactl shell --workdir /home/vanessa.linux/usernetes flux-0
```

You should see two nodes:

```bash
$ flux proxy local:///tmp/flux-u3C8of/local-0 bash
vanessa@lima-flux-0:~/usernetes$ flux resource list
     STATE NNODES   NCORES    NGPUS NODELIST
      free      2        8        0 lima-flux-[0-1]
 allocated      0        0        0 
      down      0        0        0 
```

Note that we are on the lead broker flux-0 which also is the control plane for usernetes.
Try exporting KUBECONFIG and then seeing if it's still working...

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/usernetes/kubeconfig
```
```
kubectl  get nodes
NAME              STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
u7s-lima-flux-0   Ready    control-plane   90m   v1.28.0
u7s-lima-flux-1   Ready    <none>          61m   v1.28.0
```

This is great! We now know that (with manual setup) we can run usernetes inside of a flux instance.
Now we need to put these two steps together so a batch job can both setup Usernetes and still get a working
instance.

```bash
$ kubectl  get pods -n kube-system
```
```console
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

```

## Clean Up

You can stop:

```bash
limactl stop flux-0
limactl stop flux-1
```

I haven't played around with restarting - likely services would need to be restarted, etc.
If you come back:

```bash
limactl start --network=lima:user-v2 flux-0
limactl start --network=lima:user-v2 flux-1
```

or just nuke it!

```bash
limactl delete flux-0
limactl delete flux-1
```
